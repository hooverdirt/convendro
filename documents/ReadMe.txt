== CONVENDRO RELEASE NOTES==

This is a release version of Convendro and it comes with:

- Convendro.exe (the .Net 2.0 executable).
- ffmpeg.exe (SVN version)
- commands.txt (an ffmpeg commands file for reference purposes only)
- cmddesc.xml, commands file for convendro.
- Presetsdata.xml, the presets file for Convendro. This version
  includes a recently imported WinFF preset file. These presets WILL
  NOT be included with the first official release of course.
- formats.txt, all current supported ffmpeg formats.

== HOW DOES THIS WORK? ==

A short primer.
- Drag and drop files to the listview
- Set the presets
- Press Start (or select a file and do a test-run first).

Thanks for choosing Convendro.
